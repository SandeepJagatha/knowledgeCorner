### What is the relationship between SGML,HTML , XML and XHTML?
SGML (Standard generalized markup language) is a standard which tells how to specify document markup. It’s only a Meta language which describes how a document markup should be. HTML is a markup language which is described using SGML.

So by SGML they created DTD which the HTML refers and needs to adhere to the same. So you will always find “DOCTYPE” attribute at the top of HTML page which defines which DTD is used for parsing purpose.
