### Higher Order Components 
HOC is a react component that adds some additional functionality or behaviour to an existing component that you have already written or planned to write in the furture
* HOC and prctice end up being a fantastic way to extract functionality that is common to multiple coponents or may be multiple features within our application.
* It is also grat for providing duplicate logic or maybe we are duplicating logic all over the place inside our app and if we see a location where we can kind of centralize that logic that would be the purpose of a **higher order component**
* HOC are also very commanly used with third party libraries including **react-redux**

`Component`  +  `HOC` = `Component + Additional functionality or Data` (**Enhanced** or **Composed** Component)

Example: `connect` function from `react-redux` is a HOC.
