# Spring framework

Spring Framework is one of the most popular Java EE frameworks. It is an open source and light weight framework created by Rod Johnson in June 2003.

### Core principles of Spring Framework:
1. Dependency Injection (DI).
2. Aspect Oriented Programming (AOP).

**Advantages of Spring Framework:**

1. **Light weight:**
Spring framework is light weight framework because of its POJO model implementation.
2. **Non-invasive approach:**
As we know that struts forces programmer to extend Action Class but spring framework doesn’t force a programmer to extend class or implement interface given by Spring API.
3. **Loose Coupling:**
Because of dependency injection concept, spring objects are loosely coupled.
4. **Modular fashion:**
Spring framework is designed in modular fashion. A programmer can use only needed modules and ignore the rest.
5. **Easy Testing:**
Dependency injection and POJO model makes easy to test an application.
6. **Transaction management interface:**
Spring framework provides transaction management interface for transaction management.
7. **No need of application server:**
Struts or EJB application require application server to run but spring application doesn’t need an application server.
8. **MVC framework:**
Spring framework is a great alternative to web MVC frameworks like Struts.
