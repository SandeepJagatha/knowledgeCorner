* open for extension - close for modification

### 3. LSP - Liskov Substitution Principle 


### 4. ISP - Interface Segregation Principle
ISP is basically a recommendation on how to split interfaces into smaller interfaces 

### 5. DIP - Dependency Inversion Principle
> A. High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. <br>

> B. Abstractions should not depend on details. <br>
> Details should depend on abstractions.
