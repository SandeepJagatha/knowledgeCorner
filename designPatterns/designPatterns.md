## SOLID Desin Principles 

1. S - Single-responsiblity principle
2. O - Open-closed principle
3. L - Liskov substitution principle
4. I - Interface segregation principle
5. D - Dependency Inversion Principle

### 1. SPA - Single Responsibility Principle 

A class should have one and only one reason to change, meaning that a class should have only one job.

* SPA states that a class should have just a single reason to change.
* A single class should have one primary responsibility instead of taking on lots of lots of different responsibility.


### 2. OCP - Open Close Principle
* open for extension - close for modification
* Example: amazon

### 3. LSP - Liskov Substitution Principle 


### 4. ISP - Interface Segregation Principle
ISP is basically a recommendation on how to split interfaces into smaller interfaces 

### 5. DIP - Dependency Inversion Principle
> A. High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. <br>
> Both should depend on abstractions.

> B. Abstractions should not depend on details. <br>
> Details should depend on abstractions.
