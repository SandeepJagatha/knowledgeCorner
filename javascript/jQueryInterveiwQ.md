### Explain what the following code will do:
```js
$( "div#first, div.first, ol#items > [name$='first']" )
```

This code performs a query to retrieve any <div> element with the id first, plus all <div> elements with the class first, plus all elements which are children of the <ol id="items"> element and whose name attribute ends with the string "first". This is an example of using multiple selectors at once. The function will return a jQuery object containing the results of the query.
