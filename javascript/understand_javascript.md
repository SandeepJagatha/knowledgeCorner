### Javascript Objects :
> A Collection of Name-Value pairs.

> Window and this are global objects.

### Execution Context consists:
1. Global Object
2. 'this'
3. Outer Enviornment
4. your code

> ### Hoisting:
> Setup memory space for variabes and functions 

> ### Synchronous Execution:
> Single threaded: one command at a time.

> Javascript is Single threaded execution

> ### Invocation:
> Running a function 

### Functions, Context and Variable Enviornments 
```js
function b() {
	var myVar; // myVar = undefined
    console.log(myVar);
}

function a() {
	var myVar = 2; // myVar = 2
    console.log(myVar);
	b();
}

// 1. Global execution context (created and code is executed) // myVar = 1
var myVar = 1; // global execution context
console.log(myVar);

// 2. Execution context (created and execute)
a(); // execution context
console.log(myVar);

// 1. Global execution context (created and code is executed) // myVar = 1
// Every execution context has its own variable enviornment 
```
